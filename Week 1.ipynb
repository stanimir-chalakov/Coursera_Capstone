    "##### This is my final project for the course of IBM in Data Science by Coursera. In the final project I would like to pose the question of the occurances of Café venues in the biggest cities in Canada. In particular, the cities of Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. A company that caters to Café-type of stores is looking to expand its business within Canada. Therefore, it is looking forward to finding the areas in the cities with the most cafés available and to situate their premises within these areas for the best service possible. "
